\usage{
\method{plot}{regression}(x, reg_plots = "", reg_lines = "",
  reg_conf_level = 0.95, reg_coef_int = FALSE, shiny = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Return value from \code{\link{regression}}}

\item{reg_plots}{Regression plots to produce for the specified regression model. Enter "" to avoid showing any plots (default). "hist" to show histograms of all variables in the model. "correlations" for a visual representation of the correlation matrix selected variables. "scatter" to show scatter plots (or box plots for factors) for the dependent variables with each independent variable. "dashboard" for a series of six plots that can be used to evaluate model fit visually. "resid_pred" to plot the independent variables against the model residuals. "coef" for a coefficient plot with adjustable confidence intervals. "leverage" to show leverage plots for each independent variable}

\item{reg_lines}{Optional lines to include in the select plot. "line" to include a line through a scatter plot. "loess" to include a polynomial regression fit line. To include both use c("line","loess")}

\item{reg_conf_level}{Confidence level used to estimate confidence intervals (.95 is the default)}

\item{reg_coef_int}{Include the intercept in the coefficient plot (TRUE, FALSE). FALSE is the default}

\item{shiny}{Did the function call originate inside a shiny app}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods}
