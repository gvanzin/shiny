### Example `rmarkdown` report

Below is the output from Radiant used to evaluate if the average price in a sample of diamonds is greater than \$1000.

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
suppressMessages(library(radiant))

result <- single_mean(dataset = "diamonds", sm_var = "price",
                      sm_comp_value = 1000, sm_alternative = "greater",
                      sm_sig_level = 0.95)
summary(result)
plot(result)
```
