\title{Combine datasets using dplyr's bind and join functions}
\usage{
combinedata(dataset, cmb_dataset, by = "", type = "inner_join", name = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Dataset name (string). This can be a dataframe in the global environment or an element in an r_data list from Radiant}

\item{cmb_dataset}{Dataset name (string) to combine with `dataset`. This can be a dataframe in the global environment or an element in an r_data list from Radiant}

\item{by}{Variables used to combine `dataset` and `cmb_dataset`}

\item{type}{The main bind and join types from the dplyr package are provided. \bold{inner_join} returns all rows from x with matching values in y, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all match combinations are returned. \bold{left_join} returns all rows from x, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all match combinations are returned. \bold{right_join} is equivalent to a left join for datasets y and x. \bold{full_join} combines two datasets, keeping rows and columns that appear in either. \bold{semi_join} returns all rows from x with matching values in y, keeping just columns from x. A semi join differs from an inner join because an inner join will return one row of x for each matching row of y, whereas a semi join will never duplicate rows of x. \bold{anti_join} returns all rows from x without matching values in y, keeping only columns from x. \bold{bind_rows} and \bold{bind_cols} are also included, as are \bold{intersect}, \bold{union}, and \bold{setdiff}.

\item{name}{Name for the combined dataset}
}
\value{
If list `r_data` exists the combined dataset is added as `name`. Else the combined dataset will be returned as `name`
